# simple-cctv-camera-with-raspberry-pi-4

this is a simple cctv camera with a usb camera and a motion/distance sensor

in the motion sensor one you just wait for motion

in the distance sensor one you have 5 seconds of calibration and then every iteration you check the distance with the one of the calibration to see if there was movement
