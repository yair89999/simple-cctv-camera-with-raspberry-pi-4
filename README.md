# simple-cctv-camera-with-raspberry-pi-4

this is a simple cctv camera with a usb camera and a motion/distance sensor

in the motion sensor one you just wait for motion

in the distance sensor one you have 5 seconds of calibration and then every iteration you check the distance with the one of the calibration to see if there was movement


<ul>
  <h3>How to set the motion/distance sensor and the camera?</h3>
  <li>Place the sensor on a wall or something that is on the side of the enterance</li>
  <li>Place the camera infront of the enterance to have vision on who is entering</li>
  <li>And thats it, now just connect the sensor and the camera to the pi, download the code by your sensor pick and run your own home cctv</li>
</ul>
